# 12vdc-extension
Description of a 50m 12v DC power extension

The aim is to produce a waterproof 12v DC power source using a 50m long 1mm<sup>2</sup> area cable. The problem is that the resistance would cause significant voltage drop over this length (100m round journey). The strategy here is to start with a 24V source and then use a buck/boost regulator to get a 12V supply at the end of 50m of cable. The regulator (along with a amp/volt meter to monitor power usage) are housed in a waterproof enclosure with at 12V 'cigarette lighter' socket.
